# Welcome! I'm Akhil. 

I am a computer scientist working on machine learning & artificial intelligence. Here, you can see some of my public code. See project READMEs for details and guides. You can also see [my webpage](https://akhiljalan.github.io) for more about me. 

- [**Simple Safety**](https://github.com/eepy-engineering/simple-safety): A fine-tuned LLM for content moderation, using Qwen's 0.6B parameter model and NVIDIA's Aegis Content moderation dataset. [Try it yourself](akhil.bdu.st) through the web app, and see the [Github repository](https://github.com/eepy-engineering/simple-safety) for technical details.

- [**spatialBioprocessing**](https://github.com/akhiljalan/spatialBioprocessing): Open source simulation software for bioprocess simulation and optimization with spatial variations. We handle fluid flow via semi-Lagrangian advection, parallelized Linear Programming with Gurobi, and explicit coupling of time-separated differential equations. 

- [**dynamicFBA**](https://github.com/akhiljalan/dynamicFBA): A clean and modular implementation of Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis, which solves for biomass growth and nutrient consumption of cell cultures given a metabolic model and mass balance constraints.
