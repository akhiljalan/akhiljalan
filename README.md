# Welcome! I'm Akhil. 

I am a computer scientist working on machine learning & artificial intelligence. Here, you can see some of my public code. See project READMEs for details and guides. You can also see [my webpage](https://akhiljalan.github.io) for more about me. 

- **spatialBioprocessing**: Open source simulation software for bioprocess simulation and optimization with spatial variations. We handle fluid flow via semi-Lagrangian advection, parallelized Linear Programming with Gurobi, and explicit coupling of time-separated differential equations. 

- **dynamicFBA**: A clean and modular implementation of Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis, which solves for biomass growth and nutrient consumption of cell cultures given a metabolic model and mass balance constraints.
